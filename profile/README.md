# NYU Shanghai AI Interest Group

## About Us
The NYU Shanghai AI Interest Group is a student-led organization that aims to foster a community of students interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. We host workshops and seminars to help students learn more about AI and its applications. We welcome students from all backgrounds and experience levels to join us!

## What We Do
- **Workshops**: We host workshops on various topics in AI and machine learning, such as neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing. These workshops are designed to be accessible to students with no prior experience in AI.
- **Seminars**: We invite guest speakers to give in-depth talks on their research or industry experience in AI. These seminars provide students with an opportunity to learn about the latest developments in the field and to network with professionals.
- **Newsletters**: We will send out weekly newsletter with updates on our events, AI news, and opportunities for students to get involved in AI research and projects.
